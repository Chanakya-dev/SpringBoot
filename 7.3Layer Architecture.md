### **3-Layer Architecture in Software Development**

The **3-Layer Architecture** is a common software design pattern that helps organize and separate concerns in an application. It divides the system into three layers that interact with each other, ensuring a clean separation of logic and easier maintenance. These layers are:

1. **Presentation Layer (UI Layer)**
2. **Business Logic Layer (Service Layer)**
3. **Data Access Layer (Persistence Layer)**

---

### **1. Presentation Layer (UI Layer)**

#### **Purpose**:

* This layer is responsible for **interacting with the user**.
* It displays data to the user and receives input.
* It handles user interface logic and **user interactions**.

#### **Components**:

* **UI Elements** (HTML, Angular, React, JSP, etc.)
* **Controllers/Handlers**: They process incoming requests and send responses back to the user.
* **View Templates**: Display data in a presentable format (e.g., HTML templates, React components).

#### **Responsibilities**:

* Receiving input from the user.
* Displaying results to the user.
* Forwarding requests to the **Business Logic Layer** for processing.
* Handling **session management** (in web applications).

#### **Example**:

In a web application, the **Presentation Layer** could consist of:

* **React Components** (in a React app) for displaying data to users.
* **Spring MVC Controllers** to map URLs and process requests.
* **HTML/CSS/JS** for rendering content in the browser.

---

### **2. Business Logic Layer (Service Layer)**

#### **Purpose**:

* This layer contains the **core business logic** and is responsible for processing and validating the data.
* It acts as a **middle layer** between the **Presentation Layer** and the **Data Access Layer**.
* It processes inputs received from the **UI** and performs business operations.

#### **Components**:

* **Services/Business Logic Classes**: These contain the logic and rules of the application (e.g., calculating prices, processing orders).
* **Validation Logic**: Ensure data integrity and correctness before interacting with the database.
* **API/Service Calls**: When applicable, communicate with other systems or services.

#### **Responsibilities**:

* Performing application-specific operations (e.g., calculations, transformations).
* Validating and processing the data received from the **UI**.
* Coordinating with the **Data Access Layer** to fetch, save, or modify data.
* Ensuring the separation of business logic from presentation or data persistence logic.

#### **Example**:

In an e-commerce system, the **Business Logic Layer** could include:

* A service class to handle user registration and login.
* A service class for managing shopping cart operations and order processing.

---

### **3. Data Access Layer (Persistence Layer)**

#### **Purpose**:

* This layer handles all **database interactions**.
* Itâ€™s responsible for storing, retrieving, updating, and deleting data.
* It abstracts the underlying database system and provides an API for the **Business Logic Layer** to interact with data.

#### **Components**:

* **Repositories/DAO (Data Access Objects)**: These are responsible for CRUD operations.
* **ORM (Object-Relational Mapping)** tools like **Hibernate**, **JPA**: Help map objects in the application to database tables.
* **Database**: The actual relational or NoSQL database.

#### **Responsibilities**:

* Performing CRUD operations on the database.
* Handling database queries and transactions.
* Returning results to the **Business Logic Layer**.
* Abstracting the database interactions from the other layers.

#### **Example**:

In an e-commerce system:

* **JPA Repositories** for handling product data.
* **SQL queries** for retrieving user details, order history, and payment data.

### **Benefits of 3-Layer Architecture**

1. **Separation of Concerns**:

   * Each layer focuses on a distinct responsibility, making the application easier to maintain and modify.

2. **Flexibility**:

   * You can change or replace the implementation of one layer without affecting the other layers (e.g., changing the database or UI technology).

3. **Scalability**:

   * The layers can be scaled independently depending on the demand (e.g., scaling the business logic layer or the database layer).

4. **Reusability**:

   * Business logic and data access can be reused in different parts of the application or even across different applications.

5. **Testability**:

   * You can unit test each layer independently (e.g., testing the **Business Logic Layer** without involving the **UI** or **Database**).

6. **Maintainability**:

   * With clear boundaries between layers, it's easier to maintain and debug code.

### **Example of a Simple Application Using 3-Layer Architecture**

#### **Scenario**: Hospital Management System

* **Presentation Layer**:

  * **React Frontend**: A React application where users can book appointments with doctors, view patient records, etc.
  * **Spring MVC Controllers**: These handle the incoming requests and call the appropriate services.

* **Business Logic Layer**:

  * **AppointmentService**: Contains logic for booking, updating, or canceling doctor appointments.
  * **PatientService**: Manages operations related to patient records (e.g., creating new patients, updating medical records).

* **Data Access Layer**:

  * **AppointmentRepository**: Uses Spring Data JPA to interact with the **appointments** table in the database.
  * **PatientRepository**: Uses Spring Data JPA to interact with the **patients** table in the database.

---

### **How These Layers Interact in a Hospital Management System**

1. **Presentation Layer** (React UI):

   * A user (patient) requests to **book an appointment** by filling out a form on the UI.

2. **Business Logic Layer** (Service Layer):

   * The **AppointmentService** receives the request from the **UI**, validates the data, and checks availability.
   * If valid, it calls the **AppointmentRepository** to store the appointment data.

3. **Data Access Layer** (Persistence Layer):

   * The **AppointmentRepository** communicates with the database to save the appointment information.

4. **Response**:

   * After the appointment is successfully saved, a response is sent back to the UI with the **appointment confirmation**.

---

### **Layered Architecture Flow**

1. **User Action** (Presentation Layer)

   * User sends a request via the UI (e.g., form submission).
2. **Business Logic** (Service Layer)

   * The service processes the input (e.g., validate, check rules, etc.).
3. **Data Access** (Persistence Layer)

   * The service queries or updates the database via the data access layer.
4. **Response to User** (Presentation Layer)

   * The service sends back the results, which are displayed by the UI.
